    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 6, 2026</strong></p>
    <p>At SubSentry (operated by <strong>yair sabag</strong>), we want to ensure you have a great experience with our tools.</p>

    <h2>Subscription Refunds</h2>
    <p>As SubSentry Pro is a digital SaaS product, we generally do not offer refunds once a billing cycle has been charged. You can cancel at any time to prevent the next charge.</p>

    <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
    <p>We review refund requests on a case-by-case basis. If you have experienced a technical failure that prevented you from using the service, please contact <strong>support@subsentry.pro</strong> within 7 days of the transaction.</p>

    <h2>Processing Refunds</h2>
    <p>Approved refunds will be processed by Paddle and credited back to your original payment method within 5-10 business days.</p>
