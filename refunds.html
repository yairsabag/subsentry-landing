    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 7, 2026</strong></p>
    <p>At SubSentry (operated by <strong>yair sabag</strong>), we want you to be satisfied with our service.</p>

    <h2>14-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
    <p>In accordance with Paddle's buyer terms, we offer a <span class="highlight">14-day refund policy</span>. Customers have the right to cancel their subscription and request a full refund within 14 days of the initial purchase without providing any reason.</p>

    <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>To exercise your right to a refund, please contact us at <strong>support@subsentry.pro</strong> within 14 days of your transaction. You can also manage your subscription and request refunds through Paddle's buyer support portal.</p>

    <h2>Post 14-Day Period</h2>
    <p>After the initial 14-day period, subscriptions are generally non-refundable. However, you can cancel your Pro plan at any time to prevent future billing cycles.</p>

    <p>Approved refunds are processed by Paddle and typically appear on your original payment method within 5-10 business days.</p>
